SBT plugin to build LaTeX projects with SBT! Inspired by [latex-cv](https://github.com/stuhood/latex-cv).

This tool calls native LaTeX tools (pdflatex, bibtex), so install those first.

You probably want to start with the [project template](https://github.com/emchristiansen/SBTLatexTemplate.g8).

TODO:
1. Publish to online repository, so users don't need to build this themselves.
